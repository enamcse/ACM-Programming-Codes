Accoding to problem statement ,
we have to find the maximum value of n such that
a+(a+d)+(a+2*d)+(a+3*d)+...+(a+n*d)<=K.
or n/2(2*a+(n-1)*d)<=K.
Since, there is a property of linearity.that means if value of n increases then
summation value also increases. So we can do binary search on 'n', to find 
appropriate value of n which result in summation less than or equal to K.
