Coding contest problems are designed for programming skill measurement. These contests will have multiple problems that will involve various coding techniques, speed and problem solving expertise. Each problem can be submitted multiple times. Contestants will download input file and need to generate output in their own computer and upload the output within 3 minutes time window. If you fail to do so, it will be counted as a failed submission. After 3 minutes, you can again download the input file but every time it will be different than before. You have to upload your code as well along with the output file and this code file will be verified further. If the code is invalid, your submission will be disqualified. Score for each successful submission will depend on number of wrong attempt and submission time.
