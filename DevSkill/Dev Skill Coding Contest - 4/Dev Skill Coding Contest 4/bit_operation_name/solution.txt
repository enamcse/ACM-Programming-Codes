It seems there was a missmatch in problem statement and the judge approach. It was reported by contestant and the problem
setter accepted his mistake and Apologizes for unintensional mistake. Thus the solution is not provided for this problem.
From dev skill's part we also Apologize, and want to point that the mistake was not intentional by the problem setter.
